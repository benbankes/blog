I was about 6 years old.  Our family had just finished our traditional Sunday night ice cream.  Pastor Goode had just finished a sermon on the terror of hell, and my Dad wanted to make sure we weren't going to face that when we died.  He sat me and my brother down on the couch and asked us if we understood the sermon that evening and if we wanted to invite Jesus into our hearts.  I had no reason to the contrary, so I did.

However, I don't really think I knew what was going on until a little while later.  One night after having disobeyed my Mom by not doing what she was asking (effectively passive rebellion), she gave me the [Bridge to Life](http://www.navigators.org/Tools/Evangelism%20Resources/Tools/The%20Bridge%20to%20Life) tract and asked me to reconsider whether I was really a Christian.

Before going to sleep, I read through it.  I realized that my sin separated me from God, and there was nothing I could do to get right with him.  He died for me, and all I had to do was accept this as his gift to me.  I cried.  I believed that he did that for me, although I didn't understand why.  That night, I accepted his gift.

Through my teenage years, I struggled with addictive sin.  Confessing this to my youth Pastor my Senior year of high school kicked off a process of change.  Through some frank honesty with myself, and some radical choices in obedience to God, he has allowed me to overcome this addiction and have a better relationship with him and with everyone around me.

Now I attempt to acknowledge God in everything I do so that he will direct my paths.
