I read something in the book of Psalm today that I thought beautiful and apt for waking up.

> The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament shows His handiwork.
> 
> Day unto day utters speech, and night unto night reveals knowledge.
> 
> There is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard.
> 
> Their line has gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.
> 
> In them He has set a tabernacle for the sun, which is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoices like a strong man to run its race.
> 
> Its rising is from one end of heaven, and its circuit to the other end;
> 
> And there is nothing hidden from its heat.
>
> \- Psalm 19:1-6

That's the God I serve. Â I feel like I can conquer the day.
