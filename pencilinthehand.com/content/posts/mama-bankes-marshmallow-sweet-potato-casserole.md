One way to share God's love is to share concoctions made from his creation for consumption (food).  Here is Mama Bankes' recipe for Sweet Potato Casserole.

### Ingredients

|||
| -: | :- |
| 3 cups | **cooked mashed sweet potatoes** |
| 1/2 cup | **sugar, white** |
| 2 | **eggs** |
| 1/2 tsp | **salt** |
| 1/2 cup | **milk** |
| 1 1/2 tsp | **vanilla** |
| 3 tbsp | **butter, melted** |

#### Topping

|||
| -: | :- |

| 1/3 cup | **flour** |
| 1/4 cup | **butter** |

OR

|||
| -: | :- |
| 2 cups | **marshmallows** |

### Instructions

1. Blend potatoes, white sugar, eggs, salt, butter, milk, and vanilla in a mixer.
1. Take the strings off the beaters, and throw away (the strings, not the beaters).
1. Beat again, removing the fibers. (Don't forget to unplug the mixer when you are in contact w/ the beaters.)
1. Pour into a baking dish (2qt. casserole).  You may cook as is or may add topping.  Bake 350Â°F for 35 min.
1. Topping: Mash everything together until everything sticks to everything else.

#### Notes
If you want to use marshmallows for the topping, top at about 5 minutes before the casserole is done.  For a more tender, less burnt pecan topping, top about halfway through.
