I believe that God's Spirit is displayed in nature. I have taken some nature photographs over the years, and I thought others might enjoy them, if only slightly.

While these photographs are probably some of the bestÂ  I have taken, they cannot compare to those of [Chris Anderson](http://www.flickr.com/photos/parkflavor/)
I like to think I can see a glimpse of God's smile when I look at Chris's pictures.

Mine just don't compare.
