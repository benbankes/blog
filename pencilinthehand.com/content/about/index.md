The title for this blog originates from a statement by Mother Teresa.

> I am a little **pencil in the hand** of a writing God, who is sending a love letter to the world.

More recently, a crazy awesome Christian group called [Popple](http://www.popple.us/web/about/) put the quote to music.  If you can picture an introspective person like me being energetic, you understand my reaction to hearing their song.  I might go so far as to say it resembles dancing.

I do not know that I wholeheartedly agree with the beliefs behind the quote.  Contrary to the quote, God does grant us some level of responsibility for our loving choices/actions.  See Mtt 25:4 (among others) and note who God says is doing the action.

However, my attempt is to use this site as another avenue to direct my attention more towards God's will so that I can be an instrument of His love to those around me.
