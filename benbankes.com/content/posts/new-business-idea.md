Three people have asked me if I knew any apps with a periodic checklist.  

Each of these people is good at finding apps which meet their needs.  However, they were unable to find one which solves this problem.

This problem may be ripe for a solution.  I want to take it on.  It seems small enough.

I will evaluate some new technologies, and document my progress.
- Flutter
- Go or Rust or PHP with the Doctrine ORM
- Hasura or Swagger
- WebRTC or WebSockets
