### A Brief Timeline of my Early Technical History

**2002** &#8211; At Purdue University, I am introduced to coding with MATLAB.  I write code to overlay lines on a microscopic image of aluminum crystals to calculate the average grain index.  I am awed by how quickly all of this can occur.

**2006** &#8211; I have a new-found love of solving real-world engineering problems, so I post some to a simple website.  My friends like solving them, so I keep track of their progress, like a leaderboard, on the site. I am thrilled to make something that can be used by anyone, anywhere in the world.

**2007** &#8211; A group of campus organizations want to collaborate together on a week's worth of service projects.  My brother and I create a website where leaders can see any students who signed up for their project. Hundreds of students sign up.  We are quite pleased, and quite confident in our abilities.

**2007** &#8211; I graduate with a Chemical Engineering degree from Purdue University.  I go to work making solid rocket boosters for the space shuttle program.  However, this is not as exciting as it sounds, since there is a lack of unsolved problems.

**2008** &#8211; My brother and I create a site for a company that sells plots of land.  For the first time, we get paid to program, and we love it!

**2009** &#8211; I want a backup solution for my websites.  I repurpose an old computer, spend hours learning linux, and learn how to schedule daily backups. I revel in the fact that I have automated a lot of manual work.

**2010** &#8211; I am laid off.  Chemical Engineering jobs are hard to find near me, but I have a lot of reasons to stay where I am for a while, so I keep searching.

**2011** &#8211; I land a job rebuilding a company's custom, project management application from Delphi using web technologies. I love creating code which enables others to work more efficiently.

**2012** &#8211; The company wants more features, so I build them.  I hire a team of developers. I have realized my passion - enabling people with software.
